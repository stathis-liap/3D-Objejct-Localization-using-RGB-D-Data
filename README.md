# 3D Object Localization using RGB-D Data
A full pipeline for 3D object detection, segmentation, and localization using RGB-D data.
It processes a live feed from an RGB-D camera (or a recorded dataset) to identify objects, extract their silhouettes, and compute real-world distances based on depth information.

# Features
 - Live or offline support: use a real camera or pre-recorded datasets.

 - YOLOv8 Object Detection: Fast and accurate object detection with bounding boxes.

 - SAM (Segment Anything Model): Precise object segmentation by generating masks from detected objects.

 - Depth-Based Distance Calculation:

 - Measure the real-world distance from the camera to each detected object.

 - Calculate the distance between multiple objects in 3D space.


# Pipeline Overview
## Input Handling:

 - Capture RGB-D frames either live (camera) or from dataset files.

## Object Detection (YOLO):
 - Detect objects of interest (e.g., cups, bowls, etc.).

 - Filter detections based on class and confidence thresholds.

## Object Segmentation (SAM):

 - Refine the detected regions by generating accurate masks.

 - Isolate the true silhouette of each object.

## Depth Processing:

 - For each object, locate its center using the mask.

 - Fetch the corresponding depth value (in mm).

## 3D Distance Calculation:

- Compute:

   - Distance between camera and object.

   - Distance between multiple objects.

 
## Visualization (GUI):

Show RGB images with bounding boxes and masks.

Show depth frames with object overlays.

Display distances interactively in a beautiful window.
